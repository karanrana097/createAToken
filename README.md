MyToken Project
Overview
The MyToken project is a simple Ethereum token contract written in Solidity. It allows for the creation, minting, and burning of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This README provides an overview of the project structure, functionalities, and instructions for usage.

Features
Token Creation: The contract allows for the creation of a new token with customizable details such as token name, abbreviation, and initial total supply.
Minting Tokens: Users can mint new tokens by calling the mint function, which increases the total supply and the balance of the specified address.
Burning Tokens: Tokens can be burned using the burn function, which decreases the total supply and the balance of the specified address.
Getting Started
To use the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

Install Ethereum Development Tools: Make sure you have the necessary tools installed to interact with Ethereum smart contracts, such as Truffle, Remix, or Hardhat.

Compile the Contract: Compile the MyToken.sol file using your preferred Solidity compiler. Ensure that the compiler version matches the one specified in the pragma directive.

Deploy the Contract: Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network of your choice. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat for deployment.

Interact with the Contract: Once deployed, interact with the contract using its functions to mint, burn, or query token balances.
